## Main actors & Stakeholders

[CoopITEasy](https://coopiteasy.be/en/) & [Coopdevs](https://coopdevs.org/) as  IT workers cooperatives that offer services around Odoo ERP are the main promoters of this intercooperation.

Other cooperatives, federations, second level alliances, etc. are or can be involved. Examples: 

*   [Beescoop](http://bees-coop.be/)
*   [Som Mobilita](https://www.sommobilitat.coop/)t with SOM alliance or with [The Mobility Factory](https://www.themobilityfactory.eu/) 
*   [GRAP](http://www.grap.coop/le-groupement/)
*   [FoodCoopBCN](https://foodcoopbcn.cat/) & other Catalan foodcoops
*   [OFN](https://www.openfoodnetwork.org/)

## What and Why?

We want to:

*   Develop & maintain a common base of Odoo modules
*   Promote Open Source Community around Odoo modules
*   Create documentation & maintain it in order for other cooperatives to come into the intercooperation and benefit from our previous experiences

The main goal of this intercooperation is to share forces to improve Cooperativism movement through IT, specifically with Odoo ERP. We truly believe that the Cooperativism movement can improve our society and take care of our environment.

With Open Source approach we will differentiate from other initiatives and that will give us a competitive advantage : it will be easier for new FoodCoops to use the solution and contribute with new ideas and energy, we will share the workload for the maintenance, etc.


## How?

*   Define common goals, tasks, strategy and time milestones
    *   IT Intercooperation
    *   Common Odoo projects
*   Recurrent meeting (checkpoints, annual meeting, …)
*   Common space available with information about intercooperation

    *   Community management
    *   Code
    *   Documentation

## Management

We must define what people and what tasks they should perform to coordinate all the tasks and people involved in the intercooperation.

*   Organize the checkpoint meetings and the annual meeting
*   Make sure that the tasks are done

*   Ensure common space with documentation and all intercooperation information
*   External communication to the world about our intercooperation
