# Intercooperation website

## Contributing

For small changes to the text, open the `index.md` file in Github, click the 'Edit' pencil icon and commit your change.

For larger changes, it's best to make and test them locally first (see below), and then commit to the `gh_pages` branch.

## Running locally

To run this site locally, first clone this repository. Once inside, run `bundle install` to install Jelkyll and the dependencies. From then on, run `jekyll serve` and check out `http://localhost:4000/`! This command builds your site any time a source file changes and serves it locally. The site is built in the `./_site` folder and served through Github Pages from there.

More information about how to add pages etc. can be found on the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/ ). More information about how to edit the style (custom CSS, ...) can be found [on the Cayman GitHub Pages Syle page](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman).
